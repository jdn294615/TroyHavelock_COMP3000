    1. The producer signals the consumer when it queues a word (queue_word()), and the consumer
       signals the producer when it gets a word (get_next_word()).
       
    2. 
    
    3. The consumer doesn't receive any of the words from the producer.
    
    4. Same as before.
    
    5. The producer finishes before the consumer.
    
    6. All the output gets printed at once when the producer is done.
    
    7. Same thing as before.
    
    8. Everything outputs very quickly.
    
    9. It gets its random numbers from /dev/urandom
