Part 1:

    1. The numbers appearing in the left column are the inode numbers

    2. The file takes up 262144 blocks. The file takes up 256M of disk space

    3. The file takes up less blocks but the same amount of disk space

    4. dumpe2fs prints the super block and blocks group information for the filesystem present on device

    5. The command that you would use would be fsck.<FILESYSTEM FORMAT> (e.g. fsck.ext4)

    6. There is now a lost+found/ directory in /mnt

    7. The filesystem /dev/loop0 is mounted on /mnt. I would assume this device is from /dev/zero which
       we datat dumped into foo in question 2.

    8. Rsync copies files either to or from a remote host, or locally on the current host (it does 
       not support copying files between two remote hosts). The -a option means archive mode, and the
       -v option means verbosely. The /etc option is the source directory and the /mnt is the destination
       directory.

    9. I cannot access the lost+found/ dir in /mnt anymore

    10. Converts the file as per the parameters passed to it. The notrunc means do not truncate the output 
        file

    11. The error specifies that the structure needs cleaning.

    12. I can run fsck.ext4 to make this work. It is part of the ext2/ext3/ext4 family of file systems so
        this is why it works.

    13.

Part 2 - simple kernel module:

    2. You can view the kernel logs by typing: tail /var/log/syslog

    3. lsmod shows the status of modules in the Linux Kernel

    4.
