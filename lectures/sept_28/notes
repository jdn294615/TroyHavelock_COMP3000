Lecture 07: filesystems
-----------------------

What is a file?
    key->value pair
    key:    heirarchical filename (pathname)
    value:  arbitrary number of bytes

In principal, you can use files to store very small values
    - most filesystems have a minimum file size of at least 1K, often 4K or more
    - one byte of data wastes a lot of space

A set of files "stored" together, sharing a common hierarchical root, is a filesystem

    - no storage for virtual filesystems such as /proc and /sys

When you first start a UNIX system, you start with the "root" filesystem
    - but other filesystem can be put on top by "mount"-ing them

Traditional filesystems are stored in block devices
    - but a filesystem can be anything that provides...
