Comands:

    strace      - prints all the system calls that are made when we run a process
    df          - we can see the filesystems that are mounted
    pstree      - prints a tree view of the currently running processes
    

System Calls/Function Calls:

    getpid()    - returns the process id of the current process
    getppid()   - returns the process id of the parent process
    fork()      - clones a child process and continues to run the process from the same spot,
                  returns 0 if it is the child process, returns > 0 if it is the parent 
                  process, and returns < 0 if the fork failed
                  
    sleep()     - causes the current process to do nothing for the specified amount of time
    wait()      - waits until one of its children has terminated and returns the status
    execve()    - run another binary
    sigaction() - allows us to handle signals
    
    
Notes:

    - every process must have a currently running parent
    - if a parent process dies then the kernel collects the return value and assigns a new
      parent to the child
      
    - argc = arg count, argv[] = the actual array of arguments
