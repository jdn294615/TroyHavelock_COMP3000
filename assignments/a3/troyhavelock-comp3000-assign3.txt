ANSWERS:

    1.  The first block in a filesystem is the superblock, which stores much of the information and metadata
        about the filesystem. Luckily there are backup superblocks stored at set intervals in the filesystem.

    2.  There are a few reasons why a filesystem could not be unmounted (assuming the requesting user has
        sufficient privileges). Most importantly, a filesystem cannot be umounted when it is 'busy'. What
        this means is that there are open files on it, a process has its working directory on it, or there is
        a swap file on the filesystem that is in use.

**    3.  The standard C library is a userpace API. So it is not defined in kernel space memory. Therefore it
        cannot access the standard C library. It can only access APIs that are already defined inside the 
        kernel

    4.  The effective user id (euid) of a process is used for permision checks. The uid is not always equal
        to the euid because the uid will be that of the user invoking the process, and the euid will be the
        id of owner of the process.

    5.  No we are not creating a new process when we load a kernel module. As with program there is something
        that must run at the beginning, but with kernel modules the part that runs when it is loaded simply
        sets up handlers and "interrupts" that will execute code under certain conditions or when called
        upon.
