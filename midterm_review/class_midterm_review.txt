COMP3000 Midterm Review
-----------------------

- all short answer, some very short

----- Questions from Assignment 1:
- Question 13:
    - First step is figuring out where we want to do this
        - have to do it before the execve
        - one place is before the fork
        - another is the parent
        - another is the child
            - only makes sense to do it in the child process
    - answer is in the child before the execve
    - you would use dup2() system call

----- Questions from Assignment 2:

- Question 5:
    - What does stat() return and what is the nature of the things you get back?
    - inode struct also has a device id if its a special file, so could have just checked this
    
- Question 10:
    - When we remove the lines, we generate a lot of signals very quickly, which is in general
      a bad idea
    - the con_pid is set to -1, so if we send kill to process -1, it will kill all the user 
      processes
