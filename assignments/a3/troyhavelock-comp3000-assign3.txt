ANSWERS:

    1.  The first block in a filesystem is the superblock, which stores much of the information and metadata
        about the filesystem. Luckily there are backup superblocks stored at set intervals in the filesystem.

    2.  There are a few reasons why a filesystem could not be unmounted (assuming the requesting user has
        sufficient privileges). Most importantly, a filesystem cannot be umounted when it is 'busy'. What
        this means is that there are open files on it, a process has its working directory on it, or there is
        a swap file on the filesystem that is in use.

**    3.  The standard C library is a userpace API. So it is not defined in kernel space memory. Therefore it
        cannot access the standard C library. It can only access APIs that are already defined inside the 
        kernel
