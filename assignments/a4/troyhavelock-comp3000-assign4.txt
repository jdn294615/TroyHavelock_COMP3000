ANSWERS:

    1.  The 2 inode values are different. The sshfs inode will be significantly smaller because
        it is relative to the mounted filesystem. The local inode will be much larger because
        it is relative to the local filesystem.

    2.  In the init method, the object sets the initial ino number 1 on line 18. Any time there
        is a call to create_ino() method, defined on line 13-15, the method increments the
        current inode number and returns it to the calling function.

    3.  The files UID and GID values come from the remote server. I verified this by running
        stat --format=%U%G a local file and an sshfs file and the values for the GID and UID
        were the same on both, implying they belong to the remote server.

    4.
