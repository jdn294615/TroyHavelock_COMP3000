    1.  The hard link count is the same wether I look at it locally or through sshfs

    2.  No I cannot access sshfs files as root. It appears that the filesystem is not mounted
        when I try to access it from the root user.

    3.  The inode numbers are very different. Where the filesystem is mounted (over sshfs) the
        inode is very small for test.txt (7), and on the local files have a very high inode
        number. This makes sense because on the mounted filesystem, the inode only refers to
        what is mounted, not the entire system.

    4.  It is faster to data dump to a local drive. In this case a large file that I used was
        about 450 Mb.

    5.
