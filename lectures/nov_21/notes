Where's Main?
    - lots of programs have "main" functions - a function that runs first and controls the execution of 
      the program
    - do these have "main" functions? In what sense?
        - Linux kernel modules
        - FUSE applications?
        - the Linux kernel?
        - node web applications?

In many systems, "main" just sets up event handlers
    - the event loop can be implicit or explicit
        - or there may be no loop at all, just handlers and "interrupts" of some kind
    - event loops poll (check) to see when there are new events

OS kernels are essentially the same thing
