=====================================

    1.  I see errors if I try to remove anything because it is a read only filesystem. It looks
        like memoryll.py outputs system calls.

    2.  When I make files in mnt/ it looks like they are regular files, but any file that is
        created cannot be deleted.

    3.  You need user permisions to mount and root permisions to umount

    4.  The files are lost and you can't get them back.

    5.
